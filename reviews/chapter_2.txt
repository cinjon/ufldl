Vectorization Chapter:

1. Vectorization
-- Take advantage of all the research and engineering that's gone into numerical computing
-- Try to never use explicit for-loops. Instead always use the highly optimized functions designed to quickly do numerical computing such as that with matrices.
-- The time gain from doing this is an order of magnitude or two.

2. Examples
-- Forward Propagation:
   z2 = W1 * x + repmat(b1,1,m);
   a2 = f(z2);
   z3 = W2 * a2 + repmat(b2,1,m);
   h = f(z3);
-- Logistic Regression Gradient:
   grad = x * (y- sigmoid(theta'*x))';
